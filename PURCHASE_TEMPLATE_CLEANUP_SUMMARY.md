# Purchase Template Cleanup Summary

## Issue Fixed ✅
**Error**: `NoReverseMatch at /purchases/orders/ - Reverse for 'invoice_list' not found`

## Root Cause
After removing unnecessary purchase models, there were still references to deleted URLs in:
1. Navigation menu in `base.html`
2. Template files for deleted models

## Files Fixed

### 1. Navigation Menu (`templates/base.html`)
**Removed references to:**
- `purchases:invoice_list` → Purchase Invoices
- `purchases:payment_list` → Purchase Payments  
- `purchases:return_list` → Purchase Returns

**Result**: Clean navigation menu with only:
- Purchase Orders
- Goods Receipts

### 2. Deleted Template Files
**Removed unnecessary templates:**
- `templates/purchases/invoice_detail.html`
- `templates/purchases/invoice_form.html`
- `templates/purchases/payment_detail.html`
- `templates/purchases/payment_form.html`
- `templates/purchases/return_detail.html`
- `templates/purchases/return_form.html`

## Current Purchase Navigation
```
Purchases
├── Purchase Orders
└── Goods Receipts
```

## Verification ✅
- **Django Check**: `python manage.py check` - No issues
- **Server Test**: `python manage.py runserver` - Starts successfully
- **URL Test**: `/purchases/orders/` - Returns 200 OK

## Benefits
1. **Clean Navigation** - Only shows relevant purchase features
2. **No Broken Links** - All URL references are valid
3. **Simplified UI** - Matches the simplified 3-step flow
4. **Better UX** - Users see only what they need

## Current Purchase Flow
```
1. Create Purchase Order (purchase-order status)
2. Receive Goods (goods-received status) + Add invoice_id
3. Cancel Order (canceled status)
```

The purchase module now works perfectly with the simplified 3-step flow and clean navigation.
