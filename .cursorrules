# Django ERP System - Cursor Rules

## Project Overview
This is a minimal Django ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system focused on core business operations without banking, accounting, commission, or warehouse complexity.

## Architecture
- **Framework**: Django 5.2.7
- **Database**: SQLite (minierp.sqlite)
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 5.3.2 with custom styling
- **Icons**: Bootstrap Icons
- **Charts**: Chart.js for reporting

## Core Modules
- **customers**: Customer management and ledgers
- **suppliers**: Supplier management and ledgers  
- **stock**: Product and inventory management (single location)
- **sales**: Sales orders, invoices, and payments
- **purchases**: Purchase orders, invoices, and payments
- **reports**: Business reports and analytics
- **core**: Main Django settings and configuration

## Removed Features
- ❌ **Banking**: No bank accounts, transactions, or loans
- ❌ **Accounting**: No trial balance, expenses, or income tracking
- ❌ **Commissions**: No customer or supplier commission tracking
- ❌ **Warehouses**: Single location inventory management only
- ❌ **Pre-calculated Stock**: No Stock model - inventory calculated in real-time
- ❌ **Stock Adjustments**: No manual stock adjustments - use purchase/sales orders
- ❌ **Persisted Stock Alerts**: Alerts calculated dynamically, not stored in database

## Database Models

### Customers
- `Customer`: Customer information and balances
- `CustomerLedger`: Transaction history
- `CustomerCommitment`: Payment commitments

### Suppliers  
- `Supplier`: Supplier information and balances
- `SupplierLedger`: Transaction history

### Stock
- `Product`: Product information and pricing
  - Methods: `get_realtime_quantity()` - calculates current stock from transactions
  - Methods: `get_total_stock_value()` - calculates total inventory value
- `ProductCategory`: Product categories
- `ProductBrand`: Product brands
- `UnitType`: Unit of measurement types
- **Inventory System**: Real-time calculation (no pre-calculated stock values)
  - **Formula**: Stock = Total Purchase Received - Total Sales Delivered
  - Inventory increases when purchase orders status = `goods-received`
  - Inventory decreases when sales orders status = `delivered`
  - Instant sales are automatically included (status = `delivered` when created)
- **Stock Alerts**: Calculated dynamically based on `min_stock_level`
  - Helper function: `get_low_stock_products()` in `stock/models.py`
  - Alerts appear when: `current_quantity ≤ min_stock_level` AND `min_stock_level > 0`
  - No database storage - computed in real-time
  - Available on dashboard and `/stock/alerts/` page
- **Removed Models**: 
  - `Stock` - removed, inventory calculated in real-time
  - `StockAlert` - removed, alerts calculated dynamically
  - `StockAdjustment` - removed, use purchase/sales orders for adjustments

### Sales
- `SalesOrder`: Sales order header
- `SalesOrderItem`: Order line items
- `SalesInvoice`: Sales invoice header
- `SalesInvoiceItem`: Invoice line items
- `SalesReturn`: Sales return header
- `SalesReturnItem`: Return line items
- `SalesPayment`: Sales payment tracking

### Purchases
- `PurchaseOrder`: Purchase order header
- `PurchaseOrderItem`: Order line items
- `GoodsReceipt`: Goods receipt header
- `GoodsReceiptItem`: Receipt line items
- `PurchaseInvoice`: Purchase invoice header
- `PurchaseInvoiceItem`: Invoice line items
- `PurchaseReturn`: Purchase return header
- `PurchaseReturnItem`: Return line items
- `PurchasePayment`: Purchase payment tracking

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow Django best practices
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add docstrings for complex functions
- Keep views focused and single-purpose
- Use Django's built-in form handling

### Database
- Always create migrations for model changes
- Use `python manage.py makemigrations` before `python manage.py migrate`
- Test migrations on development database first
- **Important**: Never create models that pre-calculate inventory values
- **Important**: Always use real-time calculation from transactions (purchase/sales orders)

### Templates
- Use Bootstrap 5.3.2 for consistent styling
- Follow the existing template structure in `templates/`
- Use Django template tags and filters appropriately
- Keep templates DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

### Views
- Use class-based views for CRUD operations
- Use function-based views for complex business logic
- Always handle form validation properly
- Use Django's built-in authentication and permissions
- **Inventory Views**: Use `Product.get_realtime_quantity()` for current stock
- **Stock Alerts**: Use `get_low_stock_products()` helper function
- Never query `Stock` model - it doesn't exist

### URLs
- Follow RESTful URL patterns
- Use namespaced URLs for each app
- Keep URL patterns organized and readable

## Common Commands
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run development server
python manage.py runserver

# Create migrations
python manage.py makemigrations

# Apply migrations
python manage.py migrate

# Check for issues
python manage.py check

# Create superuser
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

## Key Features
- ✅ Customer and Supplier management
- ✅ Product and inventory tracking (real-time calculation)
- ✅ Sales order and invoice management
- ✅ Purchase order and invoice management
- ✅ Payment tracking
- ✅ Business reporting
- ✅ Responsive Bootstrap UI
- ✅ PDF invoice generation
- ✅ Real-time inventory calculation (no pre-calculated values)
- ✅ Dynamic low stock alerts based on min_stock_level

## Security Notes
- Always validate user input
- Use Django's CSRF protection
- Implement proper authentication
- Sanitize data before database operations
- Use Django's built-in security features

## Performance Considerations
- Use `select_related()` and `prefetch_related()` for database queries
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Use database indexes for frequently queried fields
- Consider caching for frequently accessed data
- **Inventory Calculation**: Real-time calculations use aggregate queries
  - `Product.get_realtime_quantity()`: Sums purchase items (goods-received) minus sales items (delivered)
  - Use `select_related()` for foreign keys when calculating inventory
  - No N+1 queries - use bulk aggregation

## Testing
- Write unit tests for models and views
- Test form validation and error handling
- Test database migrations
- Test URL routing and template rendering

## Deployment
- Use environment variables for sensitive settings
- Configure proper database for production
- Set up static file serving
- Configure logging and monitoring
- Use a production WSGI server (not Django's development server)

## Maintenance
- Regular database backups
- Monitor application logs
- Keep dependencies updated
- Regular security audits
- Performance monitoring
