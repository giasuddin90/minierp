# Purchase Order Status Field Fix

## 🎯 Problem Identified
User reported: "status pending change to draft, when select pending it create problem"

## ✅ Root Cause
The form template had "pending" as a status option, but the model only accepts:
- `draft` (default)
- `sent`
- `received` 
- `cancelled`

This mismatch caused problems when users selected "pending".

## 🔧 Fixes Implemented

### 1. Updated Form Template
**Before (Problematic)**:
```html
<option value="pending">Pending</option>
<option value="confirmed">Confirmed</option>
```

**After (Fixed)**:
```html
<option value="draft" selected>Draft</option>
<option value="sent">Sent</option>
<option value="received">Received</option>
<option value="cancelled">Cancelled</option>
```

### 2. Added Status Validation
Added validation in the view to ensure only valid statuses are accepted:
```python
# Ensure status is valid (default to draft if invalid)
if form.instance.status not in ['draft', 'sent', 'received', 'cancelled']:
    form.instance.status = 'draft'
```

### 3. Set Default Selection
Made "Draft" the default selected option for new orders:
```html
<option value="draft" {% if object.status == 'draft' or not object %}selected{% endif %}>Draft</option>
```
