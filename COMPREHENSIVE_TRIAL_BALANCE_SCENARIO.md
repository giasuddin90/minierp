## **üîç Analysis of Unbalanced Trial Balance**

### **Why is the Trial Balance Unbalanced?**

The trial balance appears unbalanced because:

1. **Incomplete Journal Entries**: The system only shows the payment side of transactions
2. **Missing Revenue Recognition**: Sales revenue entries are not included
3. **Missing Expense Recognition**: Purchase expense entries are not included

### **Complete Journal Entries Required**

#### **For Sales Transactions:**
```
When Invoice is Created:
DEBIT: Accounts Receivable ‡ß≥100,000
CREDIT: Sales Revenue ‡ß≥100,000

When Payment is Received:
DEBIT: Cash/Bank ‡ß≥100,000
CREDIT: Accounts Receivable ‡ß≥100,000
```

#### **For Purchase Transactions:**
```
When Purchase Invoice is Received:
DEBIT: Purchase Expenses ‡ß≥80,000
CREDIT: Accounts Payable ‡ß≥80,000

When Payment is Made:
DEBIT: Accounts Payable ‡ß≥80,000
CREDIT: Cash/Bank ‡ß≥80,000
